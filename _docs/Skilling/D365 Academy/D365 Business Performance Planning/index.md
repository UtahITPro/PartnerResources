Welcome to the **Dynamics 365 Business Performance Planning Academy**

# Get Started with Dynamics 365 Business on-demand workshop
The ability to quickly respond to changing needs efficiently is crucial in the current business landscape. 

Business performance planning offers financial and operational planning and analytics that create a connected enterprise experience. It uses the familiar productivity tools of Microsoft Power BI and Excel. By using these tools, you can help plan and create what-if scenarios. Through the power of Dataverse, you can use data flows and Microsoft Power Platform to eliminate manual processes and achieve optimal efficiency for your organization.

The business performance planning feature set consists of two main concepts:

    Modeling data that's required for planning
    Acting on the data that's provided
