# D365 F&O Reporting Best Practices, Patterns and Anti-Patterns

## Scenario # 1 - F&O Implementation project reporting requirements
Customer and implementation partner have embarked on Finance and Operations Implementation project

## Patterns
Start reporting and business intelligence (BI) discovery and requirements gathering at the outset of the implementation.

Gather BI requirement from a process perspective
* Operational reporting
* Financial or regulatory reporting 
* Ad-hoc inquiries 
* Dashboard and analytical reports

Collect information about how these reports will be used 
* Printed out on a paper that goes with the shipment on a truck
* Create a pivot in excel to build another report
* Utilize data to drive some action in ERP system
* Submit to government authorities at the year end

## Anti-Patterns
* DO NOT leave reporting and analytics for the end of the project.

* DO NOT collect just a sample of reports from the legacy system, without any understanding of how they were being used and their purpose.
