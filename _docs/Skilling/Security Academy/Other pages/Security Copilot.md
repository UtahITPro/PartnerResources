## April 11th, 2025 UpdateðŸ“°

**Recent Update** (April 11th): **[Events](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-security-academy/microsoft-copilot-for-security#events)** and **[Get Started](/PartnerResources/skilling/microsoft-security-academy/microsoft-copilot-for-security#get-started)** |

We *finally* published **[official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/plugin-splunk?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** on the Splunk plugin in Security CopilotðŸ“Œ

MSSPs, this oneâ€™s for you: **[Security Copilot support for Azure Lighthouse is now in public preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/SecurityCopilotBlog/azure-lighthouse-support-for-mssp-use-of-security-copilot-sentinel-scenarios-in-/4384386?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)**

If you've been waiting to use Security Copilot with your managed customers, good news: support is here (well, *mostly*). So, what's the catch? As of today, MSSPs can ***only invoke Sentinel skills*** on their customer tenants via the ***Security Copilot standalone portal.*** In the future, this will expand to include other skills such as Entra, Intune, Purview, and the list goes on. What's changed? Customers are no longer required to ***purchase the SCUs themselves.***

To get started...

1. An MSSP admin should provision SCUs (including the new **[Overage SCUs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/manage-usage#how-provisioned-and-overage-scus-are-billed)**, which are $6 per SCU/hour and billed only on usage), and apply them to your Azure Lighthouse subscription
2. Make sure you have access to your customerâ€™s Sentinel workspace


Just last week, we announced **[Security Copilot agents](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/03/24/microsoft-unveils-microsoft-security-copilot-agents-and-new-protections-for-ai/?msockid=330c4da567d667543ffd5c5666b966cf)** that automate repetitive, noisy tasks like user-reported phishing alerts, conditional access policy gaps for new users and apps, and DLP/IRM alerts.

Think of these agents ***more like advanced workflows*** or simplified Logic Apps â€” automated, *mostly* trigger-based sequences for specific tasks + you can guide them with feedback/custom instructions in natural language. Most wonâ€™t take action for you, but they'll help you prioritize (e.g., classifying phish alerts as true or false positive, one-click fixes for users outside existing MFA policies, ...)

Who doesn't want to make incident response in Sentinel faster and smarter? **[This new post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/incident-enrichment-security-copilot-stefano-pescosolido-hldcf/)** walks through how you can use Security Copilot with Logic Apps and MDTI to automatically enrich incidents, cut down triage time, and get better insights.

Security Copilot egress IPs are **[now published](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/plugin-ip-address?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)** to help you send requests and receive responses from your plugins!


### Older news

You can learn how to access the Security Copilot audit log **[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/audit-log)** or how you can ingest your Security Copilot audit logs using **[this Azure Function App and PowerShell script](https://github.com/Azure/Security-Copilot/tree/main/Monitoring/IngestSecurityCopilotAuditlogs).**

It's also worth exploring **[this solution](https://github.com/Azure/Security-Copilot/tree/main/Logic%20Apps/SecCopilot-UserReportedPhishing-FuncApp_parsing)**  that automates the analysis of user-submitted phishing emails using Security CopilotðŸŽ£

Lastly, my colleague Rick created **[these easy-to-use KQL templates](https://github.com/Azure/Security-Copilot/blob/main/Plugins/MSFT_Plugin_Samples/KQL/KQL_Combined_Defender_and_Sentinel_Example.yaml)** for custom Defender and Sentinel plugins. Give them a try!

## Learn Security Copilot

Are you ready to get started? Dive into onboarding guidance, prompt engineering templates and best practices, community resources, and other relevant documentation.

### Overview

* [What is Microsoft Security Copilot?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot?view=o365-worldwide)
* [Microsoft Security Copilot experiences](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/experiences-security-copilot?view=o365-worldwide)
* [Navigate Security Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/navigating-security-copilot?view=o365-worldwide)
* [Create effective prompts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/prompting-tips?view=o365-worldwide)
* [What is a compound AI system?](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2024/02/18/compound-ai-systems/)
* [Using Microsoft Graph as a Microsoft Security Copilot Plugin with Delegated Access](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-copilot-blog/using-microsoft-graph-as-a-microsoft-copilot-for-security-plugin/ba-p/4198148)

### Onboarding

You can provision Security Copilot within the [standalone experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/get-started-security-copilot#option-1-recommended-provision-capacity-through-copilot-for-security) or in [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/get-started-security-copilot#option-2-provision-capacity-in-azure). If your organization requires tags to deploy Azure resources, use **[this ARM template](https://github.com/seanstark/azure-tools/tree/main/copilotforsecurity)** to add tags during deployment. When provisioning Security Copilot, you can purchase capacity in these **four regions:** East US, West Europe, UK South, and Australia East. Customers can provision a maximum of 100 SCUs and scale down to a minimum of 1 SCU per hr.

While there are technically no prerequisites, you'll need an Azure subscription and Microsoft Entra ID (Entra ID is required to authenticate your users). We also recommend allowing prompt evaluation anywhere with available GPU capacity for optimal results. By default, ***all users are "Copilot contributors"*** (this may vary according to existing user permissions) and ***the provisioning user is the "Copilot owner."*** Contributors cannot update data sharing options, manage SCUs, view the usage dashboard, and may only manage and publish custom plugins or upload files when allowed. Also by default, ***all security administrators and global administrators inherit Security Copilot access.***

Security Copilot will **not** elevate your level of access (e.g., to use the Microsoft Sentinel plugin, you will need the Microsoft Sentinel Reader role). However, plugin settings are managed at the ***user level***, requiring each user to enable/disable plugins and configure authentication methods. Unfortunately, there is no existing option to set plugin configurations at the ***Tenant level.***

I recommend starting with the Defender XDR Embedded Experience or Promptbooks. You can easily add tags, edit, share, run, and set the level of access to "Just me" or "Anyone in my organization." You can even create your own. Learn more about how to create your own Promptbooks **[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/build-promptbooks).** It's also critical to monitor SCU usage to manage costs and avoid disruptions (e.g., calculate your average SCU utilization over a standard 7 days). Learn more about how to monitor your usage **[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/manage-usage).** Microsoft permits ***some occasional demand spikes*** from customers that exceed their provisioned capacity at no additional charge, but if the spikes are consistent, that usually signals under provisioned capacity.

Lastly, experiment with uploading your organizations own DOCX, MD, PDF, and TXT files. You can upload files up to 20 MB in total. Security Copilot reasons over files to generate more relevant and specific responses. Learn more about uploading your own files **[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/upload-file).**

---

We recommend provisioning Security Copilot from the **Azure Portal** rather than the standalone experience, since issues like resource tagging or location policies tend to show up more clearly there. Also, by default, users with the Entra **Global Admin** or **Security Admin** roles will automatically be assigned the **Security Copilot Owner** role.

And one more tip: itâ€™s a good idea to start with a small number of SCUs and focus first on the embedded experiencesâ€”theyâ€™re much more stable and less likely to run into setup snags.

This is a great step forward for MSSPs looking to bring AI-driven security to their customers. Check out the full blog post to dive deeper and take your next steps today!

## Driving Customer Adoption

Microsoft Security Copilot enables customers and partners to defend against threats, streamline security workflows, and protect critical assets. Learn how to drive customer adoption below.

### PricingðŸ“Œ

Security Copilot pricing is consumption-based and costs approximately **$4 per SCU per hr.** A Security Compute Unit (SCU) is Security Copilot's unit of measurement of computing capacity to run a Copilot workload (i.e., prompt/Promptbook). The amount of SCUs needed depends on the complexity of the given workload. The pricing is consistent across the standalone experience and the embedded experiences as well as regions.

Why is it consumption-based and not per user? The idea is that the flexibility will allow more customers and partners to try it! That said, the output is only as good as the input, and the more plugins you use to contextually enrich complex investigations, the better (think Microsoft Sentinel pricing; the more telemetry ingested = the more coverage and insights, so long as it's not *too* much noise). There are no prerequisites, but for the optimal user experience, we recommend that customers have MDE P2 and/or Microsoft Sentinel.

To use Security Copilot, you will need to provision ***at least* 1 SCU per hr 24x7.** Therefore, the ***minimum annual price is $35,040 USD*** ($4 * 24hr per day * 365day per yr). Your ***monthly*** bill is calculated as (SCUs per hr) x $4 x 730/month or you can leverage the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/). Customers and partners can purchase SCUs in the standalone experience or in Azure and can manually provision SCUs up or down so long as there is ***at least* 1 SCU/hr.** Once an analyst is nearing the capacity limit (90%), they will receive a warning and the option to increase the capacity.

If you delete Security Copilot (zero SCUs per hr), we will retain your data for 90 days. ***Tenant-level MDTI workbench is included with Security Copilot*** and although it's not the standalone API, the TI information is easy to read and in the context of your investigations (e.g., activity groups, tooling, and vulnerabilities). From a licensing perspective, this is also **significant cost savings.**

Since computing capacity and token usage is ***variable*** **(quantifying a specific # of tokens or SCUs/workflows needed per prompt/Promptbook is difficult)**, it's important for partners to know what they can do now:

* Calculate your average SCU utilization over a standard 7 days
* Provision â‰ˆ1 SCU per Embedded Experience, â‰ˆ4 SCU per Standalone Experience, and â‰ˆ5 SCU per Automation and/or Promptbooks
* Measure SCU usage between different use cases (SOC analysts, Purview admins, Identity/access admins, etc.)
* Measure SCU usage between different levels of expertise (Junior analysts vs Senior analysts)
* Measure SCU usage across different types of investigations (incident triage, threat actor investigation, reverse engineering a malicious script, etc.)
* Explore the **[Security Copilot SCU Optimizer Solution](https://locktalk.substack.com/p/introducing-the-copilot-for-security?r=3eb8k1&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)** to simplify CfS cost management

Beyond GA, we're also collecting this data and in good time, will provide more guidance and standards on SCU usage and patterns.

### Microsoft Security Integration Reference Architecture

![CfS Reference Architecture]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/msa/CfS Reference Arch.jpg)

### Multi-tenant & Delegation Models

As of today, MSSPs can ***only invoke Sentinel skills*** on their customer tenants via the ***Security Copilot standalone portal.*** Support for other skills like Entra, Intune, and Purview is coming soon. What's changed? Customers are no longer required to ***purchase the SCUs themselves.***

To get started, an MSSP admin should 1. provision SCUs (including the new **[Overage SCUs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/manage-usage#how-provisioned-and-overage-scus-are-billed)**, which are $6 per SCU/hour and billed only on usage) and 2. apply them to their Azure Lighthouse subscription. Then, 3. make sure you have access to your customerâ€™s Sentinel workspace.

* [Azure Lighthouse](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/SecurityCopilotBlog/azure-lighthouse-support-for-mssp-use-of-security-copilot-sentinel-scenarios-in-/4384386?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
* [Grant partners access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-copilot/grant-access-external-users?view=o365-worldwide)
* [B2B collaboration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b)
* [Granular Delegated Admin Privileges (GDAP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/gdap-introduction)

### Address Concerns

* [OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)
* [Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/)
* [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Device Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/machine-groups?view=o365-worldwide)

### Technical Considerations

* **Assist a Human in Completing Work** â€“ It's a Copilot, integrations are driven by/drive human engagement, not background runtime processing of large amounts of data.
* **Have High Customer Value** â€” The cost of Generative AI is orders of magnitude higher per transaction than your average feature today and depends on a constrained hardware supply (GPUs).
* **Will be Regularly Used** â€” The best integrations will be used regularly so it is ongoing value, not a one-time value (like a configuration assistant).
