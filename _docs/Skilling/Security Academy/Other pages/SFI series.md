### Build security culture and governance with Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative series

Join Microsoft speakers for a partner-focused virtual series on the Secure Future Initiative (SFI); a multiyear commitment to evolve the way we design, build, test, and operate our products and services, to achieve the highest possible standards for security. 

Building on our October 24th event, which you can watch on-demand **[here](https://gateway.on24.com/wcc/eh/4557503/lp/4708537/build-security-culture-and-governance-with-microsofts-secure-future-initiative-october-22-23-2024-pdt-ist-bst?partnerref=DP_SCI_ORG_OTH_PN)**, this series will continue to explore SFI’s six pillars. Each session will distill security and governance best practices tailored specifically for different partners and industries, empowering you with insights, recommendations, and novel strategies. We encourage you to register for the session that best aligns with your interests.
