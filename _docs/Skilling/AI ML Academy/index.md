# AI & ML Academy

## Content

Welcome to the AI and ML Academy (AIA)! This academy includes 6 modules, all of which are built on top of each other. It incorporates technical assets as well as best practices. We include common AI/ML scenarios that we have seen throughout various industries. The objective of the academy is to help you move faster and build effective solutions. The modules are:

## Hands-on provisioned Environments

We are not currently offering fully hosted lab environments for the AI & ML Academy, but this may change in the future as we expand the content. In the meantime, you can still run the labs in your own Azure subscription. These labs are listed below:
