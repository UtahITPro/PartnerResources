# Azure OpenAI Resources

## Introduction

Azure OpenAI is a collaboration between Microsoft Azure and OpenAI, a leading research organization in artificial intelligence. It is a cloud-based platform that enables developers and data scientists to build and deploy AI models quickly and easily. With Azure OpenAI, users can access a wide range of AI tools and technologies to create intelligent applications, including natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and deep learning.

Azure OpenAI is designed to accelerate the development of AI applications, allowing users to focus on creating innovative solutions that deliver value to their organizations and customers.

## Request Access

- Rate Increase: [Azure OpenAI Service: Request for Quota Increase (microsoft.com)](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUMkkzRUlBMFBPT1ZQM01DODJNV1BEVENUTCQlQCN0PWcu)
- GPT4: GPT-4 and GPT-4-32k are now available to ***all*** Azure OpenAI Service customers. You no longer need to request access to use GPT-4 and GPT-4-32k. Availability is currently limited by region to ensure a smooth rollout. You still need to apply for the AOAI Service if you do not have that already.

## Keeping Up (May 2024 UpdateðŸ“°)

- Microsoft Build 2024 â€“ Explore technical learning, community connection, and insights into cutting-edge technologies. With 200,000+ registered attendees and 300+ sessions, itâ€™s a great opportunity to explore the latest developments in AI, data, security, and more.

##### Outline of all Azure AI Sessions at [Build 2024 (May 21st â€“ 23rd)](https://build.microsoft.com/home). Session titles that are bold have been recommended by Microsoft's AI PG.

Tooling:
-  **[The Azure OpenAI benchmarking tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-openai-benchmark)** helps you test and measure the performance of your provisioned throughput deployments. These deployments give you a fixed amount of model compute, but the actual performance depends on factors like prompt size, generation size, and call rate. The tool sends test traffic to your deployment and shows you the throughput, latency, and utilization statistics. You can use it to try different traffic patterns and find the best settings for your prompt size, generation size, and PTUs.
