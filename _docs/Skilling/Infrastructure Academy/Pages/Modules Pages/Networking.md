## Microsoft Networking Academy
Welcome to the Microsoft Networking Academy. Explore Azure Networking video sessions with demos delivered directly to partners, relevant certifications, and further resources.

## Azure Networking: The Art of The Possible and the *why* Series

The purpose of this repository is to deliver **layered, reusable, and GitHub-friendly** network architecture diagrams for Cloud Solutions Architects to run effective Azure design and skilling sessions. The content is based on **real customer and partner design sessions** with collaboration from cross-functional architects. 

The repository includes tips and tools for effective storytelling that explains the ***why* behind the design options based on requirements** and the art of the possible. The design areas include ‚Äî Azure Networking, Hybrid Connectivity architectures, routing, firewalling, load balancing, multi-region, secure by design, cross-functional networking areas, and AKS networking. The networking complexity is broken down into **layers** with **one diagram** per design area using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and now [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/). This repository will include configuration snippets to reduce lab prep. time and the need to leave the labs running for demos.
